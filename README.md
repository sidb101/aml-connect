# Aspinity AnalogMLâ„¢ Connect

- Description: blah
- Tech Stack: Tauri, Rust, React, Typescript, Vite

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Backend Setup

Rust source code is in the src-tauri directory. The application has been tested with rust version 1.72.1.
The application has been packaged using Tauri, and rust packages are managed using Tauri.

To run the integration tests, use a single thread since integration tests may use the same database (This should be considered technical debt, and fixed before the project becomes larger).
Integration tests are located in the ```src-tauri/tests``` folder and the external resources required for the test are in ```src/test_resources```. As per rust conventions unit tests are located with the code, in the same file.
Tarpaulin is used to generate coverage reports with command ```cargo test --test integration_test -- --test-threads 1```

```bash
cargo test --test integration_test project_integration_tests network_integration_test -- --test-threads 1
```

### Database Setup

We are using Sqlite to run the application.

- Ensure that you have rust version > 1.65
- Install sqlite3 for your operating system. Ensure that you have the latest version of sqlite (3.42). You might need to download the binary directly from the website. Debian seems to have an outdated version as of 7/31/2023.
- Install Diesel CLI. It is being used as our ORM Default installation will fail if it cannot find sqlite, mysql, and postgresql installed. To avoid this ask it explicilty to not check for mysql and postgres

```bash
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features "sqlite"
```

- The default DB location is based on your operating system as show below. The path can be overwritten by defining the DATABASE_PATH variable in .env

| Operating System | Location                                                                   | Example                                                           |   |   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
| Linux            | `$XDG_DATA_HOME`/`_project_path_` or `$HOME`/.local/share/`_project_path_` | /home/gaurav/.local/share/aml_connect                             |   |   |
| macOS            | `$HOME`/Library/Application Support/`_project_path_`                       | Users/Gaurav/Library/Application Support/com.aspinity.aml_connect |   |   |
| Windows          | `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}`\\`_project_path_`\\data                          | C:\Users\Gaurav\AppData\Local\Aspinity\Aml_Connect\data           |   |   |

- **All the below commands should be run inside the src-tauri folder**

- To create a new database table run

```bash
diesel migration generate name_of_table
```

- To set up the database during development(only needed when modifying database) run

```bash
diesel migration run --database-url test.db
```

- To interact with the database locally use

```bash
sqlite3 test.db
```
