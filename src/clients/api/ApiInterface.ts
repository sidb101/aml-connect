/**
 * This module would serve as interface with the Backend system. This can be any kind of server that performs processing
 * for app, like Web Server (HTTP), Rust Server (IPC), etc.
 * The api clients need to implement this interface, for the app to work correctly.
 * Right now, TauriAPI is implementing this interface.
